# HTTP form TCP
This is a personal project where I implement a HTTP protocol from scratch on top of a TCP server. 

## Why?

- I used this project to experiment what a HTTP protocol is, and how you should do it.
- I studied how network works and how to implement HTTP1.1 with golang and created it with only my own effort (no AI used).
- I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. 

These are the reason that led me to create this project.
