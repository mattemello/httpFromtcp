# HTTP form TCP
This project helped me to understand how the http1.1 protocl works. 

I created evreything in this project (NO sloppy AI used).

It was fun, and cool.

## Info

The part in the cmd folder are the server for testing that I used, the real Thing is in the internal folder.
I didn't want to make it over complicated, so I didn't subdivaded all the function in smaller func.
